# Transfer-Learning

## Objective: -

To show the difference in accuracy of a CNN Model and a Model created using Transfer Learning.

## Result: -
Accuracy using CNN                                      = 64.38% 
</br>
Accuracy using Transfer Learning ( based on ResNet50 )  = 96.63%

Difference in accuracy = 32.25%
